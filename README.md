<h1>Introduction to Spring Security</h1>

Spring Security is a powerful and highly customizable authentication and access control framework for Java applications. It provides comprehensive security services for Java EE-based enterprise software applications.

With Spring Security, you can secure your application at the method, class, and URL level. It offers robust authentication and authorization mechanisms, including support for various authentication protocols, such as JWT, OAuth, OAuth2, and LDAP.

Spring Security is easy to integrate with other Spring modules and offers seamless integration with popular frameworks and libraries, such as Spring Boot, Spring MVC, and Hibernate.

<h1>Introduction to JSON Web Token (JWT)</h1>

JSON Web Token (JWT) is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. The claims in a JWT are encoded as a JSON object that is used as the payload of a JSON Web Signature (JWS) structure or as the plaintext of a JSON Web Encryption (JWE) structure, enabling the claims to be digitally signed or integrity protected with a Message Authentication Code (MAC) and/or encrypted.

JWTs can be used for authentication and authorization in web applications, APIs, and services. They are self-contained, meaning the token itself contains all the necessary information about the user or entity, eliminating the need to store session information on the server. JWTs are signed using a secret (with the HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair (with RSA or ECDSA algorithms), ensuring that the token has not been tampered with.

In summary, JWTs provide a secure and efficient way to transmit information between parties as a JSON object, making them a popular choice for implementing authentication and authorization mechanisms in modern web development.
